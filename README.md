# MyNetflixData

## Case
Netflix provides users with the ability to download their watch history from the inception of their account. I downloaded my watch history in order to analyse it.

## Steps take to process this data
1.Exported data from my Netflix account

2.Created a new schema on MySQL Workbench

3.Created a new table within the new schema

4.Imported data from Netflix into the table

5.Added additional data columns to expand the dataset. 

## Findings
Based on my history I have predominately watched more shows than movies on Netflix. 

My vieweship has decreased over the years with the highest points of viewrship being during the Covid 19 pandemic. 

Maybe I should cancel my subscription.
